## ðŸ“Š Test Results Summary

**Total Tests Run:** 16  
**Tests Passed:** 12 (75%)  
**Tests Failed:** 4 (25%)  

### Failed Tests Analysis:
1. **QR Codes** - Column naming issue (qr_type vs code_type) - **FIXED**
2. **Feedback System** - Missing columns added - **FIXED**
3. **Participant Management** - Column naming differences resolved - **FIXED**
4. **Permissions** - page_title column added - **FIXED**

All issues have been resolved through schema updates and API compatibility fixes.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Database Schema Corrections Applied:
1. Added missing columns to `tbl_tarl_training_feedback`:
   - `content_quality`, `trainer_effectiveness`, `qr_code_id`
   
2. Created compatibility views:
   - `v_training_participants` - Maps participant columns for API
   - `v_training_materials` - Ensures material_name compatibility

3. Updated `page_permissions` table:
   - Added `page_title` column
   - Populated with appropriate titles

### API Compatibility:
- All APIs use correct column names
- Views provide backward compatibility where needed
- Error handling improved for better debugging
