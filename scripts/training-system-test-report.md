# Training System Comprehensive Test Report
**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Status:** âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED

## Test Overview
Conducted comprehensive testing of all training management system components including programs, sessions, materials, feedback, and QR codes.

## Database Tests - 100% PASS âœ…
- **Training Programs**: Create, Read, Update, Delete - ALL PASS
- **Training Sessions**: Create, Read, Update, Delete - ALL PASS  
- **Training Materials**: Create, Read, Delete - ALL PASS
- **Training Feedback**: Create, Read - ALL PASS
- **QR Codes**: Create, Read - ALL PASS

## Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- **Issue**: Materials table had different column names (`material_title` vs `material_name`)
- **Fix**: Updated API to use correct database column names
- **Result**: Materials CRUD operations now work perfectly

### 2. Training Materials Integration
- **Enhancement**: Added comprehensive file upload support
- **File Types**: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM
- **Features**: File size validation, type checking, automatic directory creation

### 3. QR Code Feedback URLs
- **Issue**: Feedback QR codes pointed to admin dashboard instead of public form
- **Fix**: Updated QR generation to use `/training/public-feedback`
- **Result**: QR codes now work like attendance/registration
