## üéØ Current Issue Analysis

### The HTTP 500 Error
Based on audit, the delete functionality error is likely due to:

1. **Database Connection**: Pool configuration or authentication
2. **Missing Columns**: Some expected columns might not exist
3. **Transaction Issues**: BEGIN/ROLLBACK transaction handling
4. **Permission Problems**: Database user permissions

### Recommended Debug Steps
1. Test basic connectivity: `http://localhost:3004/training/sessions`
2. Check server console for detailed error messages
3. Verify all required tables exist
4. Test with different session IDs
