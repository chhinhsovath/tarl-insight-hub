# Mobile Menu Fix

## Problem
The mobile menu sidebar was appearing but not overlaying properly, causing layout issues where the sidebar would push the content instead of overlaying it.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Sidebar Component Updates** (`components/sidebar.tsx`)
- Changed from `block/hidden` to `translate-x` transform approach for smoother animations
- Made sidebar `fixed` on mobile and `relative` on desktop
- Added proper z-index (`z-50`) to ensure it appears above content
- Added backdrop overlay that closes sidebar when clicked

### 2. **Layout Updates** (`app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`)
- Added `relative` positioning to the main container
- Added `w-full lg:w-auto` to main content area to ensure proper width handling

### Key CSS Changes:
```css
/* Old approach - caused layout shift */
className={cn(
  "w-64 h-screen bg-white ...",
  "lg:block",
  open ? "block" : "hidden"
)}

/* New approach - smooth overlay */
className={cn(
  "fixed lg:relative z-50 w-64 h-screen bg-white ...",
  "lg:translate-x-0",
  open ? "translate-x-0" : "-translate-x-full"
)}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Mobile (< lg breakpoint)**:
   - Sidebar is `fixed` positioned and initially translated off-screen (`-translate-x-full`)
   - When menu button is clicked, sidebar slides in (`translate-x-0`)
   - Dark backdrop appears behind sidebar
   - Clicking backdrop or any menu item closes the sidebar

2. **Desktop (>= lg breakpoint)**:
   - Sidebar is `relative` positioned and always visible
   - No transform applied (`lg:translate-x-0`)
   - Menu toggle button is hidden

## Testing
1. Open the app in a browser
2. Resize window to mobile size (< 1024px width)
3. Click the menu button in the navbar
4. Sidebar should slide in from the left over the content
5. Click the backdrop or X button to close

The mobile menu now properly overlays the content instead of pushing it aside.
