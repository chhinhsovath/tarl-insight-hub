# 🌐 Shared Hosting Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ **Critical Information**

Your TaRL Insight Hub project is a **full-stack application** with:
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- API endpoints
- Server-side authentication
- Real-time features

**Most shared hosting providers only support static HTML/CSS/JS files.**

## 🎯 **Recommended Solutions (Best to Worst)**

### 1. **🚀 Vercel (BEST - FREE & EASY)**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```
**Benefits:**
- ✅ FREE forever plan
- ✅ Full database support
- ✅ All features work
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ Custom domains
- ✅ SSL certificates

### 2. **🔥 Netlify + Supabase**
- Deploy frontend to Netlify
- Use Supabase for database (we have migration files ready)
- Cost: FREE

### 3. **☁️ Railway or Render**
- Full-stack hosting
- Cost: ~$5-10/month

### 4. **🏠 Shared Hosting (STATIC ONLY)**
- Limited functionality
- No database features
- No user authentication

## 🛠️ **If You Must Use Shared Hosting**

### Step 1: Build Static Version
```bash
./build-for-shared-hosting.sh
```

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Upload contents of `out/` folder to your hosting
2. Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. Configure your hosting to serve `index.html` for all routes

### Step 3: Limitations You'll Face
- ❌ No user login/logout
- ❌ No database (no training sessions, participants, etc.)
- ❌ No real-time features
- ❌ Only static pages work
- ❌ No API endpoints

## 📁 **What to Upload to Shared Hosting**

After running the build script, upload these files from the `out/` folder:

```
your-domain.com/
├── index.html
├── _next/
├── favicon.ico
├── dashboard/
├── training/
└── ... (all files from 'out' directory)
```

## 🔧 **Shared Hosting Configuration**

### Apache (.htaccess)
Create `.htaccess` in your root directory:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L]

# Enable compression
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</IfModule>

# Cache static assets
<IfModule mod_expires.c>
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresByType text/css "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType application/javascript "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpg "access plus 1 year"
    ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 1 year"
</IfModule>
```

### Nginx
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## 📊 **Comparison Table**

| Feature | Vercel | Shared Hosting |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Cost | FREE | $5-20/month |
| Setup Time | 2 minutes | 2 hours |
| Database | ✅ Full support | ❌ None |
| Authentication | ✅ Works | ❌ Broken |
| Training System | ✅ Full features | ❌ Static only |
| Custom Domain | ✅ Free | ✅ Included |
| SSL | ✅ Auto | ✅ Usually included |
| Maintenance | ✅ None needed | ❌ Manual updates |

## 🎯 **My Strong Recommendation**

**Use Vercel** - it's specifically designed for Next.js applications like yours:

1. **One command deployment:**
   ```bash
   npx vercel
   ```

2. **Automatic database integration** with your PostgreSQL

3. **All your training features work** perfectly

4. **Free forever** for your use case

5. **Professional URLs** and custom domains

## 🚨 **If You Proceed with Shared Hosting**

You'll essentially have a "demo" version of your app with:
- ✅ Pretty interface
- ❌ No actual functionality
- ❌ No data storage
- ❌ No user accounts
- ❌ No training management

**This defeats the purpose of your comprehensive training management system.**

## 💡 **Final Recommendation**

Save time and get full functionality:

```bash
# Option 1: Quick Vercel deployment
npm install -g vercel
vercel

# Option 2: Netlify + Supabase
# Use our existing Supabase migration files
```

Both options are **FREE** and give you a **professional, fully-functional application** instead of a static demo.
