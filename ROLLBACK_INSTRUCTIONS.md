# Flowbite Implementation Rollback Instructions

## Quick Rollback (if something goes wrong)

### Option 1: Switch to Backup Branch (Immediate)
```bash
# Switch to the pre-Flowbite backup
git checkout backup/pre-flowbite-implementation

# Copy the backup to main if needed
git checkout main
git reset --hard backup/pre-flowbite-implementation
```

### Option 2: Revert Specific Changes
```bash
# See all commits on the feature branch
git log --oneline feature/flowbite-implementation

# Revert specific commits (replace COMMIT_HASH)
git revert COMMIT_HASH
```

### Option 3: Reset to Last Working State
```bash
# Reset to the last known good commit
git reset --hard HEAD~n  # where n is number of commits to go back
```

## Gradual Rollback (if you want to keep some changes)

### 1. Identify What to Keep
- Database configuration improvements ✅ Keep
- Permission system enhancements ✅ Keep
- Specific Flowbite components ✅ Keep selected ones

### 2. Selective File Restoration
```bash
# Restore specific files from backup
git checkout backup/pre-flowbite-implementation -- path/to/file.tsx
```

### 3. Component-by-Component Rollback
```bash
# Remove specific Flowbite components
rm components/ui/flowbite-*.tsx

# Restore original components
git checkout backup/pre-flowbite-implementation -- components/ui/
```
